* Dataset 2 : Crop recommendation
  
A crop yield results from various factors. Intuitively, it is influenced by the ratio of Nitrogen ,Phosphorous and Potassium content in soil ,temperature ,humidity ,ph value of the soil and rainfall. this dataset allows the users to build a predictive model to recommend the most suitable crops to grow in a particular farm based on various parameters.
