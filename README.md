# Project-2
we will work on 2 dataset 
* Dataset 1 : Adulte income

  An individualâ€™s annual income results from various factors. Intuitively, it is influenced by the individualâ€™s education level, age, gender, occupation, and etc.

   he barplot above represents the distribution of income according to capital gain, this barplot shows us a significant difference between the two classes in terms of the value of capital gain (>50K and <=50K)

The higher the capital gain, the higher the income too. So we can conclude that the capital gain is a very important factor in determining income

  
* Dataset 2 : Crop recommendation

business problem
  
A crop yield results from various factors. Intuitively, it is influenced by the ratio of Nitrogen ,Phosphorous and Potassium content in soil ,temperature ,humidity ,ph value of the soil and rainfall. this dataset allows the users to build a predictive model to recommend the most suitable crops to grow in a particular farm based on various parameters.
